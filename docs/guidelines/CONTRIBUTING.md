### Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10 or later
- **Git**: 2.25 or later
- **pip** or **conda**: For package management
- **make** (optional): For build automation

#### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-name.git
cd project-name

# 2. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/project-name.git

# 3. Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# or with conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate project-name

# 4. Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
# or
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 5. Install pre-commit hooks (if available)
pre-commit install

# 6. Verify setup
pytest
ruff check .
mypy src/
```

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Sync with upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 3. Make changes and test iteratively
# Edit code...
pytest tests/test_mymodule.py
ruff check .
mypy src/mypackage/mymodule.py

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 5. Keep branch updated
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# 6. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/my-new-feature

# 7. Create pull request on GitHub
```

### Testing

#### Test Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for all new functionality
   - Update tests when modifying existing code
   - Use pytest fixtures for reusable components
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
   - Use descriptive test names

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Use temporary databases or mock external services
   - Clean up resources after tests

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Maintain or improve coverage
   - Aim for â‰¥70% coverage (target: 90%)
   - Focus on critical business logic
   - Don't worry about 100% coverage

#### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from mypackage import MyClass

def test_my_function_with_valid_input():
    """Test my_function with valid input."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = {"key": "value"}
    
    # Act
    result = my_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert "data" in result

def test_my_function_with_invalid_input_raises_error():
    """Test my_function raises ValueError for invalid input."""
    # Arrange
    invalid_data = {}
    
    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        my_function(invalid_data)
    assert "key is required" in str(exc_info.value)

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    """Provide sample data for tests."""
    return {
        "items": [1, 2, 3],
        "metadata": {"version": "1.0"}
    }

def test_process_data(sample_data):
    """Test data processing with fixture."""
    result = process_data(sample_data)
    assert len(result) == 3
```
